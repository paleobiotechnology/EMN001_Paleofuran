## Overview of the folder `06-figures_tables`

This folder contains the final figures and tables presented in this study.

### Supplementary Tables:

- `Dataset_S1.xlsx`: XLSX file containing the tables holding the sample and sequencing data
  information as well as the number of DNA moleculues that were available for *de novo* assembly per
  sample
- `Dataset_S2.xlsx`: XLSX file containing the results of the evaluation of the *de novo* assembly
  performance

### Supplementary Figures:

- `FigureS_ASMB01.pdf`: Supplementary figure summarising the results of the substitution types and
  minor allele frequencies that were observed when correcting the contig sequences using freeBayes
- `FigureS_ASMB02.pdf`: Supplementary figure summarising the results of the evaluation of the *de
  novo* assembly performance with respect to the contig lengths
- `FigureS_ASMB03.pdf`: Supplementary figure summarising the results of pyDamage on contig level
