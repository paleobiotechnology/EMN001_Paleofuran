# EMN001_Paleofuran
Repository for data, figures &amp; code on the EMN001 (Red Lady) BGC project

We'll soon (once we decided what to add to the publication) start to add code e.g. in form of a jupyter notebook that allows to reproduce our downstream BGC analysis.
All code to prepare the corresponding assembly(/ies) and the pydamage analysis would also be required.
Possibly we also need code for the curation of the megahit assembly / single contig.
